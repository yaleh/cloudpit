/**
 * The arithmetic behind `playwright.config.ts`'s run watchdog, and the control arm that makes its one
 * timing defect reproducible without waiting for a host load spike.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT FOUR INLINE EXPRESSIONS. The watchdog has two ceilings measured from two
 * different origins, and the origin of each is the whole of its meaning:
 *
 *   · the BOOT ceiling bounds the unbounded pre-spawn availability probe over the `webServer` urls;
 *   · the RUN ceiling bounds the whole `npx playwright test` invocation.
 *
 * Until 2026-10-29 both were measured from `runStartedAt` — the first line of the config module. That is
 * right for the run ceiling and wrong for the boot ceiling: config evaluation itself is a long
 * *synchronous* block (Vite dep-cache seed, a real client-root copy, a hash-plus-esbuild server bundle),
 * and a JS timer cannot fire while it runs. The boot deadline therefore expired *inside* config
 * evaluation and fired with a 0ms delay the moment the event loop was free again — before Playwright had
 * spawned a single webServer. `describeStall()` then read two closed ports and recorded the run as
 * `stage: "webServer-start"`, which is the class the boot ceiling exists to catch, for a run that had not
 * begun booting. Gate event `9d08ccd0-c886-4e58-b750-ea2f2eeb7ede` (2026-10-29T07:24:21Z) is that exact
 * signature: `boot ceiling crossed at 56826ms`, `port 20689 (server) is not listening, port 3471 (client)
 * is not listening`, after the same tree had passed six times in a row at lower host load.
 *
 * The fix is the origin, not the number: `bootDeadlineFrom(configEvalCompletedAt, …)` starts the boot
 * window where config evaluation ends. Raising `BOOT_CEILING_MS` past 40s instead would cross the 60s
 * the goal gate kills at, and a larger load spike would still break it — the pointer was wrong, not the
 * size. Keeping the run ceiling on `runStartedAt` (`runDeadlineFrom`) is deliberate: it is a bound on
 * the whole invocation, config evaluation included, and the 60s kill bounds exactly that span.
 *
 * `QUAY_E2E_CONFIG_EVAL_STALL_MS` is the control arm: a synchronous `Atomics.wait` injected after the
 * seeds and before the client-root copy / server bundle, so "config evaluation is slower than the 40s
 * boot ceiling" can be produced on demand instead of inferred from host load. Default 0, clamped to
 * 120000, and only ever waited on by the data-directory owner — a Playwright worker re-evaluates the
 * config with `QUAY_E2E_DATA_DIR_OWNER=false` and must not pay the stall a second time. It is a test
 * control, not a product behaviour; it is documented beside `QUAY_E2E_CLIENT_ROOT=off`, the file's other
 * control arm.

/**
 * The boot ceiling for a run whose selected specs declare `runCeilingMs` in total.
 *
 * WHY IT SCALES. The boot ceiling is a bound on the unbounded pre-spawn availability probe over the
 * `webServer` urls, and it is measured from the end of config evaluation (see `bootDeadlineFrom`). It was
 * `40_000` while every criterion ran under the 55s single-file default, and that was enough: boot-after-
 * config-eval measured 6-18.5s under 28 sibling lanes. The `resident-shell-tab.spec.ts` rounds of
 * 2026-11-06 at load1 78-195 changed the arithmetic — config evaluation itself read 2.2s, 35.4s, 48.2s and
 * 107.5s — so a fixed 40s window and the 55s run ceiling were being crossed at nearly the same moment, and
 * lifting only the run budget would merely pick whichever wall the loaded host reached first. Scaling the
 * window by the declared budget is the same lever the sibling specs already use for their run budget.
 *
 * RULE. `runCeilingMs <= SINGLE_SPEC_CEILING_MS` ⇒ `40_000` exactly (every existing default selection,
 * including the one-file gate invocation, keeps its bytes). Above that, add the declared budget over the
 * floor, capped at 120s: `min(120_000, 40_000 + (runCeilingMs - 55_000))`. The result is asserted to stay
 * `BOOT_CEILING_RUN_MARGIN_MS` inside the run ceiling, so a future cap change cannot silently make the boot
 * window the last thing standing between the run and the gate's kill.
