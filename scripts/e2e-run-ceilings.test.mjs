/**
 * The controls for `scripts/e2e-run-ceilings.mjs` — the two origins the e2e run watchdog measures from,
 * and the control arm that produced the defect behind `gap-ac323-boot-ceiling-counts-config-evaluation`.
 *
 * WHY THESE CASES EXIST. The defect is a *pointer*, not a magnitude: `BOOT_CEILING_MS = 40_000` was
 * correct as a bound on "the unbounded pre-spawn probe", and the run that died at 56826ms was killed by
 * it because the deadline was counted from `runStartedAt` — so config evaluation itself (a synchronous
 * seed + client-root copy + server bundle, 56.8s under the load of gate event
 * `9d08ccd0-c886-4e58-b750-ea2f2eeb7ede`) consumed it before Playwright spawned a webServer. A test that
 * only asserted "the boot deadline is 40s after something" would pass against that old code, so each case
 * below pins the *origin*:
 *
 *   · the boot deadline moves with `configEvalCompletedAt` — config evaluation time is NOT charged to it;
 *   · the run deadline stays pinned to `runStartedAt` — the whole invocation IS charged to it;
 *   · the control-arm knob reads 0 by default and clamps at 120000 in both directions, because a knob
 *     that only clamped above would let a negative value park the thread for an unbounded time.
 *
 * The stall itself is not waited on here: `stallConfigEvaluation` blocks the calling thread, so a case
 * that exercised it would sleep the suite. Its arithmetic is what the clamp cases read, and it is
 * exercised end-to-end by the task's AC1/AC2/AC3 runs against the real runner.
