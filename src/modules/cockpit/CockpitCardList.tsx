/**
 * The cards view's container: filters and density at the top, the card list and the Details
 * drawer. The confirmation is NOT drawn here: a pending confirmation turns the card's own bar
 * (or the drawer's) into its confirm state in place, so no dialog is mounted at the list level.
 *
 * IT IS A CONTAINER, NOT A SECOND MODEL. Every reading comes from a card binding (the page's own
 * `useCockpitCards`, or the column's shared one), and every command is one of that controller's.
 * The root publishes `data-cockpit-cards` — the same reading a scenario runner would otherwise
 * infer from the DOM — so visible order, selection, each card's shown option and confirm target,
 * and whether Details is open are all machine-readable. The pending confirm state is published
 * by the bar that draws it (`data-confirm-pending` + `data-card-id`), not by this container.
 *
 * TWO VARIANTS, ONE LIST. `page` is `/cockpit?view=cards`: the Details drawer floats over the
 * page and the list owns the global number keys. `column` is the PC right column: Details is
 * PUSHED INSIDE the list (with a back button, so the left session is never covered), and the
 * list owns no global keys — the column's own controller owns them, because it must also decide
 * whether the keyboard belongs to either input box.
