/**
 * The architecture canvas's selection and keyboard-navigation owner.
 *
 * WHY A CONTROLLER. `PlantUmlGraph` keeps selection and keyboard navigation
 * alive across DOM listeners that are registered once per mount, an async draw
 * that replaces the SVG, and renders that produce `aria-activedescendant` and
 * the polite announcement. Those readers used to be served by a cluster of
 * `useState` declarations, each mirrored into a `useRef` so a callback could
 * see the latest value: `selectedId`/`selectedRef`, the four panel-selection
 * mirrors, `navigationActive`/`navigationCursorId`/`navigationAnnouncement`
 * and their refs, the focus modality, the context menu, the last pointer type
 * and the last tap. Every new rule added another pair.
 *
 * Here there is one owner. It holds the readings in private closure state, every
 * command writes them through one `publish` path, and `PlantUmlGraph` renders
 * `getSnapshot()` through `useSyncExternalStore` and forwards its events. The
 * component no longer decides when the navigation state changes or which
 * selection the pinned highlight follows.
 *
 * The rules, unchanged from the refs this replaced:
 *
 * - The panel's selection is mirrored for the delegated listeners and the async
 *   draw. `selectedNodeId` is the primary reading the highlight, Delete and the
 *   keyboard cursor follow; the multi-member set is read for membership tests.
 * - The primary selection and the "Drill in" reading are separate on purpose.
 *   A plain click sets both; an additive click only moves the primary, because
 *   a multi-select gesture is not a request to drill. A relation click clears
 *   the primary but leaves the relation mirror for Delete/Escape (the panel's
 *   next prop write is what clears it).
 * - Keyboard navigation is a state, not a scroll: entering sets the cursor and
 *   the landing announcement, moving rewrites both, leaving clears the cursor
 *   and the announcement but remembers the last entity for the next entry.
 * - The focus modality records what produced the canvas focus. Only keyboard
 *   focus enters navigation; a pointer press focuses the host for click-then-
 *   arrow panning and must not paint a ring.
 * - The pointer type of the last press decides whether the trailing click keeps
 *   touch semantics (select only); it is consumed by that click.
 * - The double-tap drill window is measured on the injected clock, so the rule
 *   is testable without sleeping.
 *
 * Consumers: `PlantUmlGraph.tsx` (the canvas) and
 * `tests/graphSelectionController.test.ts`.
