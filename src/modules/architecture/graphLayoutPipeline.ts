/**
 * The architecture canvas's layout pipeline owner: WHICH detail tier is drawn,
 * whether the drawing is re-laid out for a new container shape, and which
 * direction that layout is drawn in.
 *
 * WHY AN OWNER. The semantic-zoom tier, the folded depth, the applied layout,
 * the aspect debounce timer, the orientation cache and the relayout lock used
 * to be a cluster of `useState`/`useRef` fields spread through
 * `PlantUmlGraph.tsx` (about 25 declarations), with the rules about when a
 * re-layout may run living in four different effects. Here every reading and
 * every timer has one home and one write path per command; the component
 * renders `getSnapshot()` and supplies the DOM-bound work (solving and writing
 * a layout onto the SVG) through injected actions.
 *
 * The rules, unchanged from the component this replaced:
 *
 * - A new drawing drops the previous semantic layout; its semantic pass runs
 *   synchronously so it never flashes at the wrong detail.
 * - A manual zoom is coalesced by the LOD debouncer: a wheel burst produces
 *   ONE semantic application, reading the settled scale at fire time.
 * - A container shape change earns a new layout only past
 *   `ASPECT_RELAYOUT_THRESHOLD`, and only after the container has settled for
 *   `ASPECT_RELAYOUT_DEBOUNCE_MS`; a smaller resize only re-fits.
 * - `lockRelayout` freezes that decision during a dock transition. Lifting the
 *   lock reconciles the container's ratio ONCE by making it the new comparison
 *   base, so the transition itself is never counted as a shape change (pinned
 *   by `layoutAspect.test.tsx`); a genuine later change still earns one layout.
 * - The orientation decision is cached per graph + canvas band, so a
 *   shape-driven re-layout of the same drawing renders only the chosen
 *   direction instead of laying the graph out twice again.
 * - `dispose` clears the debounce timer and any pending LOD application; it is
 *   idempotent and leaves the owner re-armable, because React's dev StrictMode
 *   runs an effect cleanup and re-runs the effect on the same instance.
 *
 * The clock, the two layout solvers (`solveFitScale` / `solveSemanticZoom`), the
 * LOD scheduler and the DOM-bound actions are injected, so every rule above is
 * testable without React and without a laid-out browser.
 *
 * Consumers: `PlantUmlGraph.tsx` and `tests/graphLayoutPipeline.test.ts`.
