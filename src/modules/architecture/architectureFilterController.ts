/**
 * The architecture tab's filter/display-settings owner: the file/class
 * granularity, the BFS scope and detail-tier knobs, the element/relation
 * filter, the debounced SERVER-request selection, the filter popover's
 * disclosure and position, and the inspector's "search tool output" switch.
 *
 * WHY A CONTROLLER. These readings share one rule that a component must not
 * own: a change is shown immediately, but only WIDENING (or a view switch) may
 * become a request, and a walk through the relation presets must collapse into
 * one request. That rule is a timer plus a "what the last request used" pair —
 * the exact shape the frontend standards say belongs to a React-free owner.
 * The storage seam and the clock are injected, so the debounce is asserted in
 * a test without waiting.
 *
 * Consumers: `ArchitecturePanel.tsx` (subscribes with `useSyncExternalStore`)
 * and `tests/architectureFilterController.test.ts`.
