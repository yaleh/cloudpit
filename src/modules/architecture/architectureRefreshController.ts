/**
 * The architecture tab's manual re-analysis controller: every rule behind the
 * footer's refresh entry, kept in one object that does not depend on React.
 *
 * WHY A CONTROLLER. The running state is shared server-side rather than owned
 * by the click that started it, so the tab loads the project's status on mount,
 * polls while the job runs, and starts the manual re-analysis — a start the
 * server coalesces with any concurrent caller. Those rules used to live in the
 * hook's state and mirrored refs; here there is one mutable reading plus one
 * cached snapshot, and the hook only subscribes.
 *
 * The rules, unchanged from the hook this replaced:
 *
 * - The activation read. A tab opened while another session's job is running
 *   shows that run and offers no second start.
 * - Coalescing. A start is inert while a job is already running, so a second
 *   press (or a second tab sharing the same reading) never sends a second POST.
 *   A `coalesced: true` answer still adopts the returned job as this tab's own
 *   watched run.
 * - Observed running. Only a job this tab watched `running` (or started itself)
 *   may be delivered, so a tab that mounts onto a stale `succeeded` reading does
 *   not refetch the graph and re-fit on every ordinary activation.
 * - Once per job. `onSucceeded` fires at most once for a job id, even though the
 *   status endpoint keeps answering `succeeded` afterwards.
 * - The elapsed reading. A running job re-renders once a second off the server's
 *   start instant; a poll still owns the authoritative status.
 *
 * Consumers: `useArchitectureRefresh` (which subscribes and forwards the
 * snapshot) and `tests/architectureRefreshController.test.ts`.
