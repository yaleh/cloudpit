/**
 * The architecture tab's manual re-analysis hook: the React binding for
 * {@link createArchitectureRefreshController}.
 *
 * Every rule — the activation read, the coalesced start, the observed-running
 * and once-per-job success delivery, the poll cadence and the elapsed ticker —
 * lives in the controller. This hook subscribes to its snapshot with
 * `useSyncExternalStore` and forwards the parent's success callback.
 *
 * The subscription IS the lifecycle: the controller arms its activation read and
 * timers on the first subscriber and stops them when the last one leaves, which
 * is also why React 18's StrictMode teardown-and-reset leaves the tab working.
 *
 * Consumers: `ArchitecturePanel.tsx` (the footer entry, the confirmation dialog
 * and the post-success reload/fit), `ArchitectureRefreshDialog.tsx` (the elapsed
 * formatter) and `tests/useArchitectureRefresh.test.tsx`.
