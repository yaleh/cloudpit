/**
 * The architecture canvas's zoom, viewport and auto-fit owner.
 *
 * WHY AN OWNER. Zoom used to be a `useState` plus a mirrored `useRef`, the SVG
 * viewport controller lived in another ref, and the auto-fit timer was started
 * in one effect and cleared in another. The rules about WHEN the drawing
 * follows the canvas were spread across the draw path, the resize observer, the
 * fullscreen-insets effect and the Fit-token effect. Here there is one mutable
 * reading plus one cached snapshot, one debounce timer, and one write path per
 * command; `PlantUmlGraph` only renders `getSnapshot()` and forwards the host's
 * measurements.
 *
 * The rules, unchanged from the component this replaced:
 *
 * - `auto` is the sticky fit state: a canvas size change (or a changed
 *   fullscreen inset) re-solves the scale after a debounce.
 * - Any explicit zoom flips the state to `manual` and cancels a pending
 *   auto-fit; a manual scale is never overwritten by a later resize.
 * - A Fit request token is answered at most once, and only while the drawing is
 *   in `auto` mode unless the request is forced (a fresh analysis).
 * - The zoom step is clamped to the viewport's supported range.
 * - `dispose` clears the debounce timer; it is idempotent and leaves the
 *   controller able to be re-armed, because React's dev StrictMode runs an
 *   effect cleanup and re-runs the effect on the same instance.
 *
 * The clock, the "control arm disabled auto-fit" reading and the two DOM-bound
 * actions (semantic/CSS fit and the CSS re-solve) are injected, so the rules are
 * testable without React and without a laid-out browser.
 *
 * Consumers: `PlantUmlGraph` and `tests/graphViewportController.test.ts`.
