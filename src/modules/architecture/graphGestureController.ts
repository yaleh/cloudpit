/**
 * The architecture canvas's gesture owner.
 *
 * WHY A CONTROLLER. `PlantUmlGraph` registers its native pointer/key listeners
 * once per mount, while the callbacks and readings those listeners need change
 * on every parent render. That used to be served by ten `useRef` callback slots
 * (`hoverCallbackRef`, `clickCallbackRef`, `edgeClickCallbackRef`,
 * `selectionClearCallbackRef`, `escapeSelectionCallbackRef`,
 * `toggleNodeCallbackRef`, `toggleEdgeCallbackRef`,
 * `multiSelectStartCallbackRef`, `boxSelectCallbackRef`, `drawnCallbackRef`)
 * plus the gesture readings around them: the touch multi-select mode, whether
 * Shift is held, the one-click suppression, the marquee rectangle, its copy in
 * client pixels, the pointer tier and the last drawn layout. Every new gesture
 * added another pair of declarations.
 *
 * Here one owner keeps the readings in closure state, and one `setHandlers`
 * write path replaces all ten slots: the listeners read `getHandlers()` at fire
 * time, which is what the mirrored refs used to provide. The rules it owns:
 *
 * - A Shift+drag on a fine pointer is a marquee: a rectangle in canvas space
 *   that follows the pointer and, on release, reports the drawn items it hit
 *   (through the injected box hit test). A drag that never travelled stays an
 *   ordinary additive click.
 * - A gesture that already acted on release — the marquee, or the touch
 *   long-press that starts multi-select — suppresses exactly ONE trailing
 *   click, because the browser still sends one after the pointer sequence.
 * - Shift/Ctrl/Cmd, or any press while the touch multi-select mode is on, make
 *   a click additive (toggle a member) rather than replace the selection.
 * - A coarse pointer resolves a press through the enlarged 44px node targets
 *   instead of the small drawn shape.
 * - Every event is ignored after `dispose()`.
 *
 * The DOM measurements the rules need (the canvas origin, the marquee hit test,
 * the coarse node hit test) are injected, so the controller is testable without
 * React or a live drawing.
 *
 * Consumers: `PlantUmlGraph.tsx` (the canvas) and
 * `tests/graphGestureController.test.ts`.
