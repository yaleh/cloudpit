 * transcript itself is the authoritative full text (fetched per message, over
 * its own route). So the text travels bounded — a long prompt is cut here rather
 * than allowed to make every heartbeat-sized frame carry a document.
 *
 * Exported as a value because it sits on both sides of the reduction: the driver

 * number instead of retyping it, so a change to the bound moves the measurement
 * with it.

 * driver, on the far side of the module edge from the dispatch, so the origin has

 * send has no turn yet when it answers. That would break every caller that
 * already holds a `runId` and feeds it to `run_get`, so for one minor version the
 * answer BACKFILLS the field: while the turn is unbound, `runId` is stated as the
 * `deliveryId` (`runId === deliveryId` is how a caller recognizes the backfill),
 * and `run_get` accepts either id (SPEC §8.2). Past this instant the backfill is
 * removed — an unbound send states `runId: null` — and a criterion that reads
 * THIS constant turns red on its own the day the date passes, which is what
 * forces the removal rather than leaving it to memory.
 *
 * Written as an absolute instant rather than a duration so the very same number
 * is what the criterion asserts against; the criterion reads it and checks it is
 * still in the future, and never retypes the date.

 * attached to the run that happened to write the frames. It is deliberately not
 * the ledger record — the ledger is the driver's own account (frames written,
 * leases held, rungs owed) and lives across the module edge; this is the ten
 * facts of it that a browser is entitled to.
 *
 * The channel is a **snapshot**, not a delta: the entry travels inside the whole
 * `activity.snapshot` / `activity.upsert` body, so a client that reconnects
 * reads the current queue and every terminal still inside the retention window
 * without anyone replaying anything at it (`id-relations` B-7).
 *
 * Two field-presence rules are load-bearing, and both are stated as *values*
 * rather than as absent keys so an entry's shape never depends on its state:
 *
 * - `reason` is `null` unless the delivery was cancelled, because a `completed`
 *   delivery has no reason to state and a client that had to test `'reason' in
 *   entry` before drawing a row would be branching on a shape rather than on a
 *   fact.
 * - `text` is `null` once the delivery reaches a terminal, and bounded
 *   ({@link DELIVERY_TEXT_MAX_CHARS}) while it is live. The text is what makes a
 *   queued row readable; an ended delivery's words belong to the transcript, and
 *   carrying them would keep every finished message alive in a snapshot that is
 *   re-sent on every change.
