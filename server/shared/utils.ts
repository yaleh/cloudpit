 * (`chat-run-registry.service.ts`, and through it `chat-websocket.service.ts`
 * and `chat-control.service.ts`) both import it from here; `modules/websocket`'s
 * barrel re-exports it for the MCP gateway's criteria, which print it beside
 * their readings.
 *
 * It lives in this leaf rather than in either consumer because the two sides
 * sit on an ESM evaluation-order boundary: the providers module may not import
 * the websocket module (that edge would close a cycle and trip the
 * `providerRegistry` TDZ), so before this leaf each side carried its own copy of
 * the predicate — two spellings of one string. The predicate stays in this root evaluation leaf (the split's util helpers
 * live in `./utils/` and re-export through here), so both sides reach the same
 * single reader without closing anything.
 *
 * Read at CALL time, never cached at module load: a criterion sets the variable
 * in its own body, after every importer has been evaluated, so a module-level
 * constant would answer the flag-off value and the criterion would measure the
 * old path while believing it measured the new one. The flag is off unless the
 * variable is exactly `1`.
