 * The ONE quay-fleet child-process pipeline shared by the Quay module's CLI readers.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Four sibling modules — the locator, the project-id join, the interface-session
 * registry and the initiatives view — each carried a byte-for-byte copy of `defaultExecFile` and
 * `parseJsonObject`; two carried `canonicalPath`, and two carried the same "resolve the binary,
 * report a fixed error when there is none, otherwise execute" runner. Every copy promised the
 * same thing in a comment and every copy could drift on its own (indeed the locator's handshake
 * wording already differed from the other three). This file is the one definition: consumers
 * inject the same seams they always did, the failure text stays verbatim, and a change to the
 * classification has one place to land.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE THROWS. A failed spawn, a timeout and an unreadable document are all readings,
 * because every consumer is a server surface that must keep answering when the fleet is absent.
 *
 * Import discipline (AC-394): this leaf imports only `node:*` and its own directory's siblings,
 * so it adds no cross-directory edge in `server/`.
