/**
 * Cross-repository contract tests: Cloudpit against the INSTALLED quay-fleet.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PROVES. Every `quay-fleet` invocation Cloudpit consumes is run against the real
 * binary on this host, and its JSON answer is checked against the declaration in `shapes.ts`.
 * The handshake goes first: if the fleet declares a contract this build does not speak, the run
 * reds and names the contract instead of exercising verbs whose output may have moved under us.
 *
 * WHY IT IS FAIL-CLOSED. A host without the fleet is a RED, not a skip: a contract test that
 * silently skips on the machine that would have caught the break protects nothing. The explicit
 * `CONTRACT_TESTS_ALLOW_MISSING_FLEET=1` switch exists for hosts that genuinely have no fleet
 * (CI without a release); when set, the file reports ONE skipped case whose reason says exactly
 * what is not being checked.
 *
 * THE OPERATOR'S FLEET HOME IS READ-ONLY TO THIS FILE. Read-only verbs run against the configured
 * home (they cannot write it). The two writing verbs — `registry interface-session set|clear` —
 * are run against a `QUAY_FLEET_HOME` created with `mkdtempSync` under the OS temp directory, and
 * `assertTemporaryHome` refuses to spawn them otherwise. The AC4 guard then re-stamps the real
 * home's `registry.json` and reds if its mtime/size moved: that file is the only durable target
 * of the exercised verbs, while the rest of the home belongs to the resident fleet service and is
 * rewritten every tick by the service itself (guarding those would make the test flaky, not
 * safe).
 *
 * RUNNER NOTE: a server test, run through `tsx --test` (see `scripts/test.sh`); vitest's include
 * is `src/**` and would find no tests here.

 * The files the RESIDENT fleet service rewrites on its own schedule.
 *
 * AC3 says the home's files must not move during the run. Taken literally that is a race with the
 * service: it rewrites `heartbeat.json` and its ledgers every 60s tick, so a literal whole-home
 * assertion would red roughly once every dozen runs without anything in this suite being wrong.
 * The guard therefore EXEMPTS exactly these service-owned files and requires every other file —
 * including `registry.json`, `initiatives.json` and the decision ledger — to stay identical.
 * `ledgers/` and `acceptance-windows/` are wholly service/operator written, so they are matched by
 * prefix; the initiative decision ledger is checked separately below.
 *
 * The service also owns whole directories beyond `ledgers/`: every tick appends to
 * `context/events/<date>.jsonl`, rewrites `behavior/attention-window.json`, and (with
 * `--knowledge-assessment`) rewrites `knowledge/{cases,facts,intake,origins,trigger}`. Leaving those
 * out of the prefix set made this guard red on a tick crossing the ~7s contract run — observed on
 * 2026-11-01 as `context/events/2026-11-01.jsonl` and, on the isolated re-run, as seven
 * `knowledge/**` files. None of the exercised verbs writes those trees (the only writing verbs run
 * against a temporary `QUAY_FLEET_HOME`), so exempting them keeps the guard's actual target — the
 * real `registry.json` / `initiatives.json` — fully literal.
 *
 * `service.log.jsonl` and the service's atomic-write temp files belong to the same class. The
 * service appends+fsyncs the log on its schedule, and every whole-file rewrite goes through
 * `<target>.tmp-<pid>-<token>` before the rename. Both were observed crossing a run on 2026-11-06:
 * the full suite caught `service.log.jsonl` plus `attention.json.tmp-2889651-… (removed)`, and an
 * isolated re-run caught `service.log.jsonl` alone in a 10s window while the develop baseline
 * happened to miss a write in its own window. The temp exemption is keyed to the RESIDENT service's
 * pid (read from `service.pid`), not to the name shape: a temp file left by an exercised verb would
 * still red, while the service's own transient artifact cannot.
 *
 * `molten/` is the service's resident loop state (`resident-readings.json`, `resident-state.json`,
 * `state.json`, action/budget ledgers). It is written every tick and belongs to the service, not to
 * the operator; a contract run on 2026-11-06 caught `resident-readings.json` + `resident-state.json`
 * moving. It is exempt by prefix like the other service-owned trees.
