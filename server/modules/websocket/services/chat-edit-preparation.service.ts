/**
 * How an edited conversation recovers the context its replacement turn continues
 * from.
 *
 * The two shapes are independent of the session's lifecycle mode: a per-run
 * session and a resident session can each need either one, and a resident
 * session needs its host closed in addition to whichever recovery applies. That
 * independence is the whole point of stating this as a value — the previous
 * gateway branched "provider rewinds" against "resident rebuild" as if they
 * were mutually exclusive, which silently skipped the host close for a provider
 * that branches (Codex).
 *
 * - `resume-at-anchor`: the provider can resume partway, so the anchor rides
 *   along to its runtime as a resume option. `keepThroughId` is the last row to
 *   keep, or `null` when the edited turn was the first prompt and the
 *   conversation starts over.
 * - `binding-replaced`: the provider cannot resume partway and replaces the
 *   session's provider transcript binding on disk (Codex's `thread/fork`). The
 *   run that follows carries no anchor at all — the provider runtime resumes
 *   from whatever binding the session now points at.

 * registry admit the turn, and then applies the plan inside the admitted run's
 * `beforeRun` hook. Split in two on purpose: an edit that is refused — busy
 * session, unknown anchor, unsupported provider — must not close a host or

 *
 * The order `apply` enforces is:
 *
 *  1. announce the truncation, so every watching tab drops the superseded turns
 *     before a slow close/rewind begins;
 *  2. close the resident host, strictly — a refusal stops the chain;
 *  3. let the provider prepare its own recovery (rewind/replace the binding);
 *  4. the caller starts the run, which resolves the *latest* binding.
 *
 * Lifecycle and provider recovery are composed here as two independent facts.
 * This service never branches on a provider name; the provider states whether
 * it rewinds through its own capability, and the session states its lifecycle
 * mode.
