/**
 * The shared approval-request service: the one owner of the "ask a connected
 * client and wait for its answer" protocol that both resident providers use.
 *
 * Claude's per-run and resident paths asked this question first (AC-168) and
 * Codex's app-server asks it for five server-request kinds (AC-438). The state
 * and the wire frames are identical — a `permission_request` frame on the run's
 * writer, an `action_required` notification, a bounded wait, then
 * `permission_resolved` — so they live here once instead of in either provider.
 * The per-provider differences are arguments: `provider` names the frame's
 * provider id and `onPermissionPhase` is the provider's optional observer
 * (Claude feeds its turn tracker through it; Codex has no equivalent and does
 * not pass one).
 *
 * Consumed by `claude-runtime.provider.ts` (which re-exports every name below
 * unchanged), `codex-runtime.provider.ts` (the permissions facet the
 * `provider-runtime.service` fan-out reaches), and the Codex approval broker in
 * `providers/list/codex/`.
 *
 * Lives in `providers/shared/base/` rather than `providers/services/` on
 * purpose: `modules/providers/services` already imports
 * `providers/list/codex/codex-transcript-format.ts`
 * (`session-conversations-search.service.ts`), so a `list/codex` import back
 * into `services` would close a new directory cycle in the AC-394 budget
 * ratchet. `providers/shared/base` is a leaf of the providers component — it
 * points only at `server/shared/**`, `modules/notifications` and itself — so
 * both provider implementations may import it without becoming a cycle member.
