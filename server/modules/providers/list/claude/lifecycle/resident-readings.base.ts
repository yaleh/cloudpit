   * is that a conversation turn is beginning (`system/init`) at a moment when
   * **nothing this host pushed is waiting to be bound to it** and under a uuid

   * ledger that answers it rather than a count of rounds in flight. That
   * distinction is the whole criterion: a merged turn leaves stale bookkeeping
   * on the FIFO, and reading `state.rounds.length` let one stale round mask
   * every later unattended turn — a background task's follow-up, a cron firing,
   * a peer message — so nothing reported that the work had finished.
   *
   * A command the CLI started under a uuid nothing here pushed (a cron firing,
   * E9 §9.4) is `foreign`, not a delivery waiting for a turn, so it never makes
   * the turn delivered; its uuid stays out of everything this host exposes.
   *
   * Never throws and never reports. An unattended turn that cannot be opened is
   * not a failure: the run registry may already hold a run for the session, and
   * in that case the frames stay with the last writer, which is what this mode
   * did before it could open runs at all.
