/**
 * The session digest's second tier (LLM) settings: the shipped defaults, the ONE environment
 * entry (`SERVER_SETTINGS_PATH`, the same contract `server/modules/settings/server-settings.ts`
 * reads), and a reader that re-reads the file whenever its modification time changes.
 *
 * WHERE THE BLOCK LIVES. The task's independent block is `observation.sessionDigest` in the
 * SERVER settings file — the same deployment-editable file that already carries
 * `observation.wallLimit`. This reader owns that block alone; the server-settings loader keeps
 * ignoring it (unknown keys are ignored), so the two readers can land independently.
 *
 * WHAT IS REUSED, NOT COPIED. A digest call is an ordinary chat completion, so the gateway
 * (`protocol`, `baseUrl`, `authScheme`, `timeoutMs`, `temperature`, …) and, by default, the key
 * are the reply-suggestions module's. The independent block adds only the knobs that are about
 * THIS tier: `enabled`, `model`, `maxPerHour`, `minTurnChars` and an optional `apiKeyFile`
 * override. That is why no gateway key is duplicated here. The file machinery itself (the `~`
 * expansion, the typed field readers, the key-file grammar and the mtime cache) is
 * `server/shared/settings-file.ts`; this module keeps only the block's schema.
 *
 * THE READING IS NEVER FATAL. A missing file is the normal "feature off" state; a malformed
 * known key falls back to its shipped default and is named in `problems`; an unknown key is
 * ignored. Nothing here throws, because a bad knob must never stop the server or a chat turn.
 *
 * THE KEY IS NEVER REPORTED. The resolved key is kept in memory and never echoed into
 * `problems`, logs or status objects.
 *
 * Consumers: `session-digest-llm.ts` (through the process-wide source it builds) and the tier
 * criterion in `tests/session-digest-llm.test.ts`, which drives the reader over files it owns.
