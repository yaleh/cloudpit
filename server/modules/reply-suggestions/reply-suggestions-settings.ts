/**
 * The reply-suggestions settings file: the shipped defaults, the ONE environment
 * entry ({@link REPLY_SUGGESTIONS_SETTINGS_PATH_ENV}), and a reader that re-reads
 * the file whenever its modification time changes.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AND NOT ENVIRONMENT KNOBS. The model, gateway, temperatures and caps
 * are the things an operator tunes while trying this feature out. They live behind
 * a named file so that an edit reaches the NEXT request without a restart or a
 * rebuild; the environment carries only the file's LOCATION. There is deliberately
 * no second spelling of any knob in the environment. The FILE FORMAT is flat (see
 * `config/reply-suggestions.settings.example.json`); the grouping below happens
 * only in memory, so every existing settings file keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * GROUPED BY RESPONSIBILITY. `upstream` is what a client needs to reach the
 * gateway, `generation` is what shapes the answer, `limits` is the call budget,
 * `usageLog` is the ledger switch and `diagnostics` is what the reader observed
 * (source, path, problems, the configured switch and where the key was named).
 * A consumer takes the one group it needs instead of picking fields out of a
 * flat 27-field object.
 *
 * THE KEY IS AN OPAQUE VALUE. `upstream.credential` is an {@link ApiCredential}:
 * its private field holds the secret, only `reveal()` returns it, and `toString`,
 * `toJSON` and `util.inspect` all answer `[redacted]`. A stray `JSON.stringify`,
 * log or `util.inspect` of the whole reading therefore cannot leak it. The key
 * file itself is read while the file is (re)parsed; the value is never echoed
 * into `problems`, logs, status objects or error messages. A key file wider than
 * mode 600 is reported as a problem but is NOT fatal. The file machinery (the `~`
 * expansion, the typed field readers, the key-file grammar and the mtime cache)
 * is `server/shared/settings-file.ts`; this module keeps only the file's schema.
 *
 * THE READING IS NEVER FATAL. A missing file is the normal "feature off" state; a
 * malformed known key falls back to its shipped default and is named in
 * `problems`; an unknown key is ignored. Nothing here throws, because the server
 * must start and serve every other route whatever this file says.
 *
 * Consumers: `reply-suggestions.service.ts` (through `readSettings`),
 * `reply-suggestions.module.ts` (which owns the one source instance),
 * `server/modules/observation/session-digest-llm-settings.ts` (the gateway
 * reading it merges under its own `observation.sessionDigest` block) and the
 * settings criterion in `tests/reply-suggestions-settings.test.ts`.
