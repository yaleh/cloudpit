/**
 * Reply-suggestions module — barrel.
 *
 * TWO production consumers, both through this barrel:
 *   · `server/index.ts`, which builds the module over the providers module's transcript
 *     reader and mounts it under `/api/reply-suggestions`;
 *   · `server/modules/observation/session-digest-llm.ts`, which borrows the same direct-HTTP
 *     client, the same gateway settings reading and the same local usage ledger for the
 *     observation wall's LLM digest tier — one upstream path, not a second copy of it.
 * Nothing else may deep-import this directory.
