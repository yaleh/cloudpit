 * sentence here would be a second, lossier copy of data the journal already has in full. The
 * classifier turns it back into a structured entry keyed on the payload's own `kind`.
 *
 * WHY THE PAYLOAD IS NOT SHRUNK TO A SENTENCE. The 2026-10-13 task exists because the journal could
 * not say WHY four whole segments were lost, and the three causes (`upstream-close`,
 * `replay-exhausted`, `pairing-mismatch`) are told apart by numbers — the close frame's code, the
 * socket generation, the replay spend. A prose line would put those numbers out of reach of the
 * reader that has to do the attribution on the next natural recurrence.
 *
 * NOTHING IS SENT TO THE PAGE. This is a measurement, not a disposition: the page already gets the
 * segment's fate from `onSegmentOutcome`, and a new frame here would change what the browser reads.
