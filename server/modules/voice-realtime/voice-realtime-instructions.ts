/**
 * The session instructions the proxy installs once the Realtime connection is up.
 *
 * A RELAY, deliberately. The first version told the model to call `session_send` only for
 * "something to be done" and not "to answer questions you can answer yourself"; measured against
 * the real model that forwarded 7 of 12 test utterances, and the other 5 were answered in a TEXT
 * reply nothing displays — so the user spoke, saw their words transcribed, and then saw nothing
 * (`experiments/voice-realtime-prompt/`). Claude is the one who reasons; this model only carries
 * the words over.
 *
 * Kept here rather than in a UI string table because it is a PROMPT, not copy:
 * it names the function the model must call and the argument the server's
 * whitelist reads back, so it has to agree with `VOICE_REALTIME_TOOLS`' `session_send`
 * schema rather than with anything the browser renders.
 *
 * THE MODEL IS A PEN, NOT AN AGENT (2026-10-14 ruling, journal `e650117b`; replay measured in
 * `experiments/voice-realtime-relay-mode-replay/`). The prompt used to spend a whole paragraph
 * opening a four-way choice for what to do about the work that is running — let it continue by
 * calling no function, add to it, change where it goes, or stop it — and the real model took the
 * first arm literally: while Claude was running it judged that nothing new needed carrying and
 * answered in text, so four utterances from the 2026-10-14 morning session never reached the
 * session. The ruling fixes the role: this model tidies the person's words and passes them on, and
 * whether they are worth passing on is never its call. The paragraph is gone, replaced by one
 * sentence that leaves the model no no-op arm and forbids a text reply. On the three most recent
 * real captures the shipped four-arm prompt produced 31 text replies to the person's speech and
 * lost or materially cut ≈22 message units; the reworded prompt produced 0 of each.
 *
 * THE STOP JUDGEMENT CARRIES NO WORD LIST, and that half predates the ruling. The sentence used to
 * spell out the words that counted as a stop (the list is preserved in SPEC §18.1 F-5; it is
 * deliberately NOT repeated in this file, so the prompt is not one grep away from being a keyword
 * table again), which is a CONDITIONAL MAPPING from words to an abort: it makes the model a matcher
 * rather than a reader, and it fails on exactly the utterance that motivated this — the user asked
 * for the in-flight work to be cancelled without using any of those words, so the model relayed it
 * as ordinary speech and the run kept going (SPEC C-2 forbids the mapping; SPEC §18.1 F-5 records
 * the journal). The exception is stated as the JUDGEMENT it always was: the model reads what the
 * person meant, and a stop is whatever reads that way. The `intent` field is the audit of that
 * reading, so the instructions name it and the reason it is owed (SPEC §6.2).
 *
 * THE INTERRUPT ALWAYS CARRIES THE PERSON'S WORDS (2026-10-14 ruling, Q1). The interrupt stays the
 * model's own judgement, but the call now states their words in `message` and the reading behind
 * the judgement in `intent`; the words are always present, even when all they asked for was the
 * stop. The second live test lost exactly that case — the person asked to interrupt and only the
 * intent reached the CLI (journal `e650117b`). The replay measured the change: interrupts that
 * carried the person's words went 5/6 → 6/6, and the ones that should have interrupted 6/10 →
 * 8/10. The proxy enqueues the carried `message` BEFORE it aborts (`sessionInterrupt`, E10/U2), so
 * the words and the run they correct reach the CLI in the same turn rather than a turn late.
 *
 * THE SEMANTIC WIDENING (SPEC §0.3 D-6, §18.4 G1, GOAL-041 AC-342). The exception names two
 * judgements — "stop", and "correct the direction of what is running" — and a correction travels as
 * the `message` field of the SAME `session_interrupt` call rather than as a second `session_send`.
 * It stays a semantic judgement over what the person meant, so the keyword list that used to sit
 * here must not come back (the negative-control scan in
 * `voice-realtime-instructions-no-stop-words.test.ts` holds that; AC-340 stays green).
 *
 * THE RELIABILITY PASS (2026-10-14 ruling; task `gap-voice-busy-preemption-instruction-reliability`).
 * A word list is not the only way this prompt can make the model a matcher; §1.4 of the proposal
 * measured the SAME sentence judged `session_send` on the live session and `session_interrupt` on
 * replay — "该抢不抢" — and the shape of the failing window is that the wish to stop or redirect
 * arrives wrapped in words the person is ALSO adding (a pause plus a fresh request). The model read
 * the added words as an addition and queued the whole thing behind the run. The clauses kept here
 * are the whole of that reading: the wish is read from the WHOLE utterance rather than from the part
 * that looks like a command, added words are the correction to carry rather than a reason to queue,
 * and one sentence names that exact failure so the model has the mistake in view. It adds no
 * threshold, no duration and no relatedness gate (SPEC D-6 stands): it is instruction text only, and
 * the negative-control scan in `voice-realtime-instructions-no-stop-words.test.ts` still holds it to
 * the same form.
 *
 * AC7 CORRECTED THE WORDING (2026-10-14, task `gap-voice-relay-mode-a-prompt-drop-continue-arm-and-session-status`).
 * The first draft of this text stated the rule without the framing below and the replay's arm B —
 * which replays THIS array — measured 4 text replies to the person's speech on `e650117b`, twice, so
 * not a flake; the experiment's arm A measured 0 on the same capture in the same session. The clauses
 * that close the gap are arm A's: the relay opens by saying it tidies the person's words and passes
 * them on rather than taking part, the pass-on sentence keeps the fragment-joining and the
 * no-paraphrase limit, and the rule ends by naming the only choice the model has as HOW a thing is
 * delivered. With them the same three-capture replay reads 0/0/0 text replies. Nothing was dropped
 * from the reliability pass above.
 *
 * This array is the text the replay's arm B replays verbatim, so the measured prompt and the shipped
 * one are the same bytes.
 */
/**
 * The relay's instructions for one closing-turn mode.
 *
 * ONE SENTENCE MOVES. After a stop the shipped prompt tells the model to "reply with the single word
 * OK"; with no closing turn that request has nowhere to land and the model spends the NEXT
 * utterance's response on it (the first rollback attempt, 2026-10-10: three of five spoken
 * instructions heard and never relayed). So `silent` replaces that sentence and nothing else, and
 * `respond` is the shipped text byte for byte — {@link VOICE_REALTIME_INSTRUCTIONS}.
 *
 * Consumed by `server/index.ts` (the `instructions` seam) and by the criteria.

 * host that is gone, a driver with no turn model) does the phase reading decide, which keeps every
 * non-hosted path byte-identical to before this reading existed.
 *

 * honest — the model is told what stopped, what tool it stopped in, and that the words that follow
 * are the current instruction.
 *
 * TWO FORMS, ONE RULE. With a tool name the sentence names it (`inFlightTool` read from the host's
 * activity record at the stop); with no readable tool it says only that the turn was interrupted and
 * that partial changes may remain — it never invents a tool. The unreadable case is the whole of

 *
 * WHAT THE SENTENCE MUST NOT SAY. SPEC §11.4 forbids the interruption path from claiming it undid
 * anything: no `revert` / `rollback` / `undo`，no 「撤销」/「回滚」. The words are "may still be
 * present" because that is exactly what the proxy knows — it never inspected the changed state, so
 * it cannot say the changes exist, only that the tool was mid-flight when it was cut off. A criterion
