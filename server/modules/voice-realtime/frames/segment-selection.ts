 * Which segmented-path protocol this connection speaks, and whether the caller asked for it.

 * Resolution order, highest first: the seam (what a criterion or the composition root
 * passes), then {@link VOICE_REALTIME_SEGMENT_COMMIT_ENV}, then the adopted protocol —
 * `manual`, the one P0a's S1 probe concluded the endpoint supports.
 *
 * `explicit` distinguishes "someone asked for the segmented path" from "this is just the
 * default". The distinction is the diagnosis service's, not the connection's: a `turns`
 * script arriving over HTTP is spoken as segments only when the operator asked for it, so
 * the existing continuous multi-turn diagnosis keeps its meaning (see
 * `runVoiceRealtimeDiagnosis`). Consumers: this service's connection handler and
 * `voice-realtime-diagnose.service.ts`.
