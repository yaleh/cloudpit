  /**
   * The uplink VAD's exit path (scheme §6.3): drain the gate, then `input_audio_buffer.commit` →
   * `response.create` → a bounded wait → teardown.
   *
   * TRIGGERED BY THE USER'S OWN EXIT — the browser's close frame and nothing else (a raw socket drop is a
   * disconnect, where §6 says the relay has no choice of teardown order and the browser is gone anyway).
   * This is §0's ONLY, BOUNDED exception to "never send `response.create`": the scope is this one path,
   * and the normal-flow send decision is never driven by any upstream VAD event.
   *
   * The ORDER is the whole point. A bare commit into an immediate close drops the answer the commit just
   * flushed, because the endpoint had not yet committed, transcribed and relayed it (§6.3; the shipped
   * manual path sends the SAME pair, `frames/voice-realtime-bridge.service.ts`'s `writeSegmentClose`).
   *
   * WHY THE PAIR IS SKIPPED WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO COMMIT. The reason for the pair — "do not let an
   * immediate close swallow the tail the flush just released" — only holds while there IS a tail. With
   * nothing flushed, nothing sent since the endpoint's last commit, and no turn open upstream, the commit
   * can only be refused ("buffer too small, or have no audio") and the `response.create` still opens a
   * whole response over the history: live 2026-10-16 01:06 (journal `cae49fed`), 44 s of zero frames
   * after a delivery ended with the endpoint re-answering an utterance it had already been given, its
   * `session_send` this time carrying the SAME sentence REWRITTEN (the model's own retelling of a
   * transcript the relay had forwarded verbatim). That is a message the person never said, and a whole
   * context's worth of spend to produce it. So the pair is omitted — TOGETHER, never one of the two —
   * only when all three readings below say there is nothing to close:
   *
   *   1. the gate's flush released no frames ({@link UplinkVadGate.flush});
   *   2. this connection has forwarded no frame upstream since the endpoint's last `committed`
   *      ({@link uplinkVadFramesSinceCommit} — the flush's own frames are (1)'s reading, so they are
   *      deliberately not added to this one);
   *   3. the upstream has no unclosed `speech_started` (`upstreamTalking`).
   *
   * Any one of them false ⇒ the original behaviour, unchanged and in the original order. What is
   * omitted is the whole pair on a connection that has nothing to say; what is NEVER omitted is the
   * commit of a tail that exists — the old "never short-circuit the commit" warning is about that
   * order, and it still holds.
