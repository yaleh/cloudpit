    // words, or any call with a fresh `committed`/transcription behind it, is a delivery.

    // comparison cannot see, and applying both here would let this guard mask the other's false

  /**
   * Writes the ONE audit record for a stop (SPEC §6.2, §10.3 / C-3) and answers the three readings
   * the receipt carries.
   *
   * WHY THE JOURNAL GETS A LINE RATHER THAN A NEW SEAM. The proxy's `log` seam is already the
   * connection's on-disk record — `voice-realtime-log.ts`'s recorder tees every line into this
   * connection's journal and classifies the ones it recognises — so a stop that printed nothing
   * structured was the one thing on this connection with no record at all. One `session_interrupt
   * audit {json}` line puts it beside the segment, send and rotation entries the same way they got
   * there, with no second assembly point and no new argument for `server/index.ts` to remember.
   *
   * `intent` and `heard` are the MODEL's words, so both are read as "a string, or nothing": an
   * omitted `heard` is a real reading (`null`), and a stop that named no reason is a real reading too.
   * Neither is invented, and `intent: ''` is never written in place of an absent one — a fabricated
   * reason on an audit line is worse than an empty field.
   *
   * A MISSING `intent` IS RECORDED, NOT REFUSED (this task's whole point). The schema makes `intent`
   * OPTIONAL and the executor does not check it (see `frames/voice-realtime-tools.ts`,
   * `voice-realtime-live-executor.ts`): the real form journal `b5d01c21` shows is a model that
   * called the stop with only a `message`, and refusing it at the transport dropped the stop AND the
   * correction. So an absent or blank `intent` is written as `intent: null` AND FLAGGED with
   * `intentMissing: true`, which is what keeps C-3's "误停可审计" satisfiable — the record says the
   * model gave no reason rather than pretending it gave one.
   *
   * `inFlightTool` is the tool the interrupted run was executing, read ONCE per stop from the host's
   * own activity record ({@link hostRunActivity}) and carried into the journal, the receipt's sibling
   * reading and the next turn's note (`buildInterruptAftermathNote`) so all three name the same tool.
   * When the reading cannot be taken — no host activity for this session, a seam that throws — it is
   * `null` rather than a guess, and the next turn gets the tool-free form of the note (C-3's rule:
   * record what is known, say `null` for the rest). A run that was executing NO tool also reads
   * `null`; the two are the same reading at this seam, which is why the note says "interrupted" and
   * only names a tool when there is one.
   *
   * `noteCarried` says whether THIS stop's aftermath note left with THIS stop's own correction
   * ({@link lastDeliveryCarriedNote}). It is the reading that keeps the two halves of the aftermath
   * honest when they come apart, which is exactly the case a stop-with-correction can produce: a note
   * that went out on the correction while the abort then found NO run (`outcome: 'no-run'`) or was
   * refused (`outcome: 'refused'`) — the message carries an interruption note, and whether it should
   * is only answerable if the audit says the note rode it. A stop that carries no correction is
   * `false` by construction: its note is armed after the abort and rides a LATER message, so this
   * stop's own delivery never carried one.

  /**
   * `session_interrupt`, the STOP path — the ONE handler that deliberately does not go through
   * {@link deliverSessionSend}.
   *
   * WHY IT BYPASSES THE SEND MACHINERY. A stop has to work precisely when a send is stuck: while a
   * `session_send` is parked in the busy-wait (the single-flight `sending` held) or while the queue
   * is full (`VOICE_QUEUE_FULL`), a stop that queued behind the send it is meant to cancel would
   * never run — the user says stop and the run keeps going. So it does NOT touch `sending`, it does
   * NOT open a coalescing window, and it is NOT judged by the delivery bound. It calls the bound
   * session's own interrupt and answers at once (AC2/AC3).
   *
   * WHAT A STOP IS NOT. It is not a teardown: the voice connection, the microphone and the messages
   * already accepted all survive it (AC4). It ends the ONE run in flight (the control service's
   * abort verb — the SAME one the browser's stop button and the MCP `session_interrupt` reach), and
   * the backlog's first message is released immediately rather than waiting for its coalescing
   * window, so the person's next words are carried without a pause. `depth` is read BEFORE that
   * release, so the number the bar shows still counts everything the stop did not throw away.
   *
   * AND IT IS AUDITED. Every outcome of this path — a run aborted, nothing in flight, or a call the
   * voice plane refused before the abort — goes through {@link writeInterruptAudit}, and the same
   * three readings ride back on the receipt. The stop is the one tool whose whole effect is
   * destructive, so it is the one tool whose reason for firing has to be readable afterwards
   * (SPEC §10.3, C-3).
   *
   * AND IT IS FENCED (SPEC §18.4 G2, GOAL-041 AC-343). This is the MODEL's stop path only — the
   * browser's stop button and Esc reach the control service's abort directly over `chat.abort` and
   * never pass through here, so the fence cannot restrain them (D-7's "UI 停止键不受栅栏约束"). The
   * model's call is first offered to {@link decideModelInterrupt}: an utterance the current run
   * already covers, or the same `triggerSeq` repeated, is answered `{stopped:false, reason:'covered'}`
   * with one `outcome:'covered'` audit line and NO second `stopped` frame — the debounce, not a
   * second stop.
   *
   * AND IT ENQUEUES A CORRECTION BEFORE IT ABORTS (SPEC §18.4 G1, GOAL-041 AC-342). When the call
   * carries a `message` — the corrected instruction for an interrupt the model judged a change of
   * direction (D-6) — that text is delivered into the CLI's own queue FIRST, and the abort waits on
   * the enqueue's confirmation (see {@link enqueueConfirmed}). Only a confirmed enqueue aborts,
   * which is what makes the corrected words and the run they correct land in the SAME turn rather
   * than the correction arriving a turn late (the E10/U1, E10/U2 readings). An enqueue that could
   * not be confirmed answers `{stopped:false, reason:'revision-not-enqueued'}` and aborts nothing.
   *
   * AND THAT CORRECTION IS WHERE THE AFTERMATH NOTE RIDES (ruling 2026-10-16). The note is armed
   * BEFORE the enqueue, so the message the stop's own words go in on is the message that carries the
   * interruption's explanation — see {@link aftermathNote}. A stop with no correction has no such
   * message, keeps its note for whatever is delivered next, and the two are told apart in the audit by
   * `noteCarried`.
