/**
 * The ASR provider seam: the address book that hands an adapter out by id.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT IS NOT HERE ANY MORE. The types every adapter satisfies, the error vocabulary and
 * the guards (`baseMimeType`, `declaredAcceptsMime`, `classifyUpstreamFailure`) live in
 * `./asrContract.ts`, a leaf that imports no adapter. They are re-exported below so every existing
 * consumer keeps its import specifier; the re-export is one-way, which is what makes this file's
 * dependency on the adapters acyclic at file level.
 *
 * TWO COMPILER CONFIGURATIONS COMPILE THIS FILE (root and `server/tsconfig.json`), because both
 * ends of the seam read it. See `./asrContract.ts` for what that constraint allows.
 *
 * UNKNOWN IDS ARE FAIL-CLOSED. The id is stored in user-level configuration, so a typo or a
 * version skew makes an unregistered id a reachable state. `resolve` throws rather than falling
 * back to a default provider: a silent fallback's worst case is a user who believes they are
 * transcribing with the service they chose while the previous one answers. `tryResolve` is the
 * non-throwing form for callers that want to report that state instead of catching it.
